# The ATTENDANCE COORDINATION BOT🌟

## Introduction🤪

This telegram bot when I am holding my position inside a club which the lab access is assigned to only the Main Committees, which I think I must figure out a method where I can 

> **"Collect the attendance of the Main Committees (which has the lab access) and forward the poll result to the rest of the members group."** 

With this thinking in mind, I started to code up this telegram bot using google app script (Why google app script? Cause I am more familiar with it I guess😉)

## Features🔥
* Customise the poll options.
* Customise the message that can be send out together with the polls.
* Customise the timing to collect/close/forward the poll to the respective groups. 

## Prerequisite🤔
Not really have one, but maybe the **PASSION** ? Oh ya, some basic understanding of how a google spreadsheet works👍🏻.
